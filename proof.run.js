  Runs zero or more tests emitting unified test output.

  `proof run` exits successfully, with an exit code of zero, regardless
  of test failures or abnormal exits.

description:

  The `proof run` runs zero or more test programs, gathering their
  output and emitting unified test output to STDOUT. It does not perform
  an error reporting itself.

  The test programs must emit valid Perl Test::Harness output.

  The output can be saved to file or piped back into proof with one of
  the other proof commands to report progress or emit alternate formats.
